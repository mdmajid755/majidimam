# first, define min and max dice points at once

# then, we should have while loop 

# roll the dices

# print dice1 score and dice2 score each time  

#calculate dice total

#print dice total for the player

#if dice is rolled between 7-11

   #player wins bc points added

#if dice is rolled between 2-3-12

    #player loses bc points subtracted

#loop continue untill winner points hit 1000 or 0 lose the game 

#exit the game and start it again.
