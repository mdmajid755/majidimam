# the app starts

# entities or classes of two players are created and the total points of 100 are assigned for each player

# entity or classes of a round (or a roll) where wagers of players are added is initialised, rounds will have
# attributes of the winner and wager and dice value

# create a gameplay class that is responsible for generating rand number as the dice value
# when classes are created we start the initialisation of the cli part of the app

# initialize the classes
# start the gameplay loop
    # collect config from gameplay (amount of rounds), and setup it as loop params (how many iterations we are going to have)
    # start gaming loop cycles
        # show the points balance for every player
        #  collect the wagers from players via prompt cli params for round N
        # trigger the gameplay roll dice method
        # define the winner
        # subtract the amt from loser and assign to the winner
        # assign to wager to a winner
        # go to the step 1 until number of rounds is over
    # end of the loop
# end of the loop if exit is cliecked
