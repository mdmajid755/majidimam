#First, a class named "Die" is defined. This class represents a die with a specified number of faces. It also includes a "roll" method that simulates rolling the die.

#Ask the player's initial score.

#The game loop begins. The game continues as long as the player's score is greater than 0 and less than 1000. (While Loop)

#The player's current score is displayed on the screen.

#The player is asked to enter a bet. To enter a valid bet, they must input a value between 1 and their current score. They can also exit the game by typing "exit."

#The player's entered bet is accepted and checked. If "exit" is typed, the game loop terminates.

#Two dice are rolled. Two instances of the "Die" class are created, and each of them returns a random value.

#The values of the dice are displayed on the screen.

#The total value of the dice is calculated.

#The player checks whether they have won or lost the bet. If the total value of the dice is 7 or 11, the player wins, and the bet is added to their score. If the total value is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses, and the bet is subtracted from their score.

#The game continues or ends based on the player's winning or losing of points.

#If the player accumulates 1000 or more points, a message "Congratulations! You've won the game!" is displayed. If the player has 0 or fewer points, a message "Sorry, you've lost the game." is displayed.

#The player is given the option to restart the game or exit. Depending on the player's choice, the game either restarts or ends.
